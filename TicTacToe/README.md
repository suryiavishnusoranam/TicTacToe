# Overview

{Brief description of my Tic Tac Toe Program:}
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a  application that allows two players to play the unique game of Tic Tac Toe. 
The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbols (X or O). 
The objective is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, 
or diagonally.

{My purpose of writing this program:}
My purpose of writing this program was to learn and practice C# programming and the Avalonia UI framework by 
creating a simple yet engaging game. This project helped me understand key concepts such as event handling, 
UI design, and game logic implementation.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Description of tools that I used to develop this software:}
JetBrains Rider: An integrated development environment (IDE) for .NET development, which I used on macOS.
Avalonia UI: A cross-platform UI framework for .NET, which allows building desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

{Description of the programming language that I used and any libraries.}
The programming language used for this project is C#. The main library utilized is the Avalonia UI framework, 
which provides tools and controls to create a modern and responsive user interface.

# Future Work

{List of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Animations: Introduce animations for moves and winning lines to make the game more visually appealing.
- Score Tracking: Add functionality to keep track of player scores across multiple games.
